        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            Developers' Society of BITS Goa has been primarily responsible for providing innovative technical solutions to most of the issues in BITS Goa. We began as Mobile Applications Club with the sole purpose of developing mobile applications. But after so many years we have now evolved into a club that has proficient developers from the field of Android Development, Web Development, Game Development and Internet of Things (IoT). All the four verticals work in harmony to develop innovative softwares that solve many technical issues on campus.

        <h2>Web Deisgn</h2>
        <p>
            Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. 
            The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design); authoring, 
            including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and search engine optimization. 
            Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, 
            although some designers will cover them all.[1] The term "web design" is normally used to describe the design process 
            relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps 
            web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and 
            if their role involves creating markup then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.

        <h2>Video Game Development</h2>
        <p>
            Video game development is the process of developing a video game.
             The effort is undertaken by a developer, ranging from a single person 
             to an international team dispersed across the globe. Development of traditional
              commercial PC and console games is normally funded by a publisher, and can take 
              several years to reach completion. Indie games usually take less time and money
               and can be produced by individuals and smaller developers. The independent game
                industry has been on the rise, facilitated by the growth of accessible game 
                development software such as Unity platform and Unreal Engine[1] and new online 
                distribution systems such as Steam and Uplay, as well as the mobile game market
                 for Android and iOS devices.

        <h2>Android Software Development</h2>
        <p>
            Android software development is the process by which applications are
             created for devices running the Android operating system. Google states
              that[3] "Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages" 
              using the Android software development kit (SDK), while using other languages 
              is also possible. All non-Java virtual machine (JVM) languages, such as Go, 
              JavaScript, C, C++ or assembly, need the help of JVM language code, that may 
              be supplied by tools, likely with restricted API support. Some programming languages
               and tools allow cross-platform app support (i.e. for both Android and iOS). 
               Third party tools, development environments, and language support have also continued
                to evolve and expand since the initial SDK was released in 2008. The official Android 
                app distribution mechanism to end users is Google Play; it also allows staged gradual 
                app release, as well as distribution of pre-release app versions to testers.

        <h2>User Experience Design</h2>
        <p>
            User Experience (UX) Design (UXD, UED, or XD) is the process of creating evidence-based, 
            interaction designs between human users and products or websites. Design decisions in UX
             Design are driven by research, data analysis, and test results rather than aesthetic preferences 
             and opinions. Unlike User Interface Design, which focuses solely on the design of a computer
              interface, UX Design encompasses all aspects of a user's perceived experience with a product
               or website, such as its usability, usefulness, desirability, brand perception, and overall
                performance. UX Design is also an element of the Customer Experience (CX), which encompasses 
                all aspects and stages of a customer's experience and interaction with a company.
